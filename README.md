# URL Shortener Python

This is my first full-stack app built with Python.

I used the microframework Flask to build the back-end, the front-end is really simple and built with HTML and CSS.

Tech Stack:

- HTML
- CSS
- Python
- Flask
- PostgreSQL

The app allows the user to give a long url, and it will return a shorter url that the user can use to access that long url. Or alternatively the user can click "see all urls" button to see all of the long/short urls pair already in the database.

The urls are stored in a PostgreSQL Database and the app is deployed on Heroku.
